# About

  Generic resource pool.  Can be used to reuse or throttle expensive resources such as
  database connections.
  
## 2.0 Release Warning

The 2.0.0 release removed support for variable argument callbacks.  When you acquire
a resource from the pool, your callback *must* accept two arguments: (err, obj)

Previously this library attempted to determine the arity of the callback, but this resulted
in a variety of issues.  This change eliminates these issues, and makes the acquire callback
parameter order consistent with the factory.create callback.

## Installation

    $ npm install generic-pool

## Example

### Step 1 - Create pool using a factory object

    // Create a MySQL connection pool with
    // a max of 10 connections, a min of 2, and a 30 second max idle time
    var poolModule = require('generic-pool');
    var pool = poolModule.Pool({
        name     : 'mysql',
        create   : function(callback) {
            var Client = require('mysql').Client;
            var c = new Client();
            c.user     = 'scott';
            c.password = 'tiger';
            c.database = 'mydb';
            c.connect();
            
            // parameter order: err, resource
            // new in 1.0.6
            callback(null, c);
        },
        destroy  : function(client) { client.end(); },
        max      : 10,
        // optional. if you set this, make sure to drain() (see step 3)
        min      : 2, 
        // specifies how long a resource can stay idle in pool before being removed
        idleTimeoutMillis : 30000,
         // if true, logs via console.log - can also be a function
        log : true 
    });
    
### Step 2 - Use pool in your code to acquire/release resources

    // acquire connection - callback function is called
    // once a resource becomes available
    pool.acquire(function(err, client) {
        if (err) {
            // handle error - this is generally the err from your
            // factory.create function  
        }
        else {
            client.query("select * from foo", [], function() {
                // return object back to pool
                pool.release(client);
            });
        }
    });
    
### Step 3 - Drain pool during shutdown (optional)
    
If you are shutting down a long-lived process, you may notice
that node fails to exit for 30 seconds or so.  This is a side
effect of the idleTimeoutMillis behavior -- the pool has a 
setTimeout() call registered that is in the event loop queue, so
node won't terminate until all resources have timed out, and the pool
stops trying to manage them.  

This behavior will be more problematic when you set factory.min > 0,
as the pool will never become empty, and the setTimeout calls will
never end.  

In these cases, use the pool.drain() function.  This sets the pool
into a "draining" state which will gracefully wait until all 
idle resources have timed out.  For example, you can call:
    
    // Only call this once in your application -- at the point you want
    // to shutdown and stop using this pool.
    pool.drain(function() {
	    pool.destroyAllNow();
    });
    
If you do this, your node process will exit gracefully.
    
    
## Documentation

    Pool() accepts an object with these slots:

                  name : name of pool (string, optional)
                create : function that returns a new resource
                           should call callback() with the created resource
               destroy : function that accepts a resource and destroys it
                   max : maximum number of resources to create at any given time
                         optional (default=1)
                   min : minimum number of resources to keep in pool at any given time
                         if this is set > max, the pool will silently set the min
                         to factory.max - 1
                         optional (default=0)
     idleTimeoutMillis : max milliseconds a resource can go unused before it should be destroyed
                         (default 30000)
    reapIntervalMillis : frequency to check for idle resources (default 1000),
         priorityRange : int between 1 and x - if set, borrowers can specify their
                         relative priority in the queue if no resources are available.
                         see example.  (default 1)
                   log : true/false or function -
                           If a log is a function, it will be called with two parameters:
                                                    - log string
                                                    - log level ('verbose', 'info', 'warn', 'error')
                           Else if log is true, verbose log info will be sent to console.log()
                           Else internal log messages be ignored (this is the default)

## Priority Queueing

The pool now supports optional priority queueing.  This becomes relevant when no resources 
are available and the caller has to wait. `acquire()` accepts an optional priority int which 
specifies the caller's relative position in the queue.

     // create pool with priorityRange of 3
     // borrowers can specify a priority 0 to 2
     var pool = poolModule.Pool({
         name     : 'mysql',
         create   : function(callback) {
             // do something
         },
         destroy  : function(client) { 
             // cleanup.  omitted for this example
         },
         max      : 10,
         idleTimeoutMillis : 30000,
         priorityRange : 3
     });

     // acquire connection - no priority - will go at end of line
     pool.acquire(function(err, client) {
         pool.release(client);
     });

     // acquire connection - high priority - will go into front slot
     pool.acquire(function(err, client) {
         pool.release(client);
     }, 0);

     // acquire connection - medium priority - will go into middle slot
     pool.acquire(function(err, client) {
         pool.release(client);
     }, 1);

     // etc..

## Draining

If you know would like to terminate all the resources in your pool before
their timeouts have been reached, you can use `destroyAllNow()` in conjunction
with `drain()`:

    pool.drain(function() {
	    pool.destroyAllNow();
    });

One side-effect of calling `drain()` is that subsequent calls to `acquire()`
will throw an Error.

## Pooled function decoration

To transparently handle object acquisition for a function, 
one can use `pooled()`:

    var privateFn, publicFn;
    publicFn = pool.pooled(privateFn = function(client, arg, cb) {
        // Do something with the client and arg. Client is auto-released when cb is called
        cb(null, arg);
    });

Keeping both private and public versions of each function allows for pooled 
functions to call other pooled functions with the same member. This is a handy
pattern for database transactions:

    var privateTop, privateBottom, publicTop, publicBottom;
    publicBottom = pool.pooled(privateBottom = function(client, arg, cb) {
        //Use client, assumed auto-release 
    });

    publicTop = pool.pooled(privateTop = function(client, cb) {
        // e.g., open a database transaction
        privateBottom(client, "arg", function(err, retVal) {
            if(err) { return cb(err); }
            // e.g., close a transaction
            cb();
        });
    });

## Pool info

The following functions will let you get information about the pool:

    // returns factory.name for this pool
    pool.getName()

    // returns number of resources in the pool regardless of
    // whether they are free or in use
    pool.getPoolSize()

    // returns number of unused resources in the pool
    pool.availableObjectsCount()

    // returns number of callers waiting to acquire a resource
    pool.waitingClientsCount()
